        Spider-Man's secret identity is Peter Benjamin Parker. Initially, Peter was depicted as a teenage high-school
        student
        and an orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents, Richard and Mary Parker,
        died in
        a plane crash. Lee, Ditko, and later creators had the character deal with the struggles of adolescence and young
        adulthood and gave him many supporting characters, such as Flash Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson, and Harry Osborn;
        romantic
        interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and the Black Cat; and enemies such as Doctor Octopus, the Green Goblin,
        and
        Venom. In his origin story, Spider-Man gets his superhuman spider powers and abilities after being bitten by a
        radioactive spider. These powers include superhuman strength, agility, reflexes, stamina, durability,
        coordination, and
        balance; clinging to surfaces and ceilings like a spider; and detecting danger with his precognition ability
        called
        "spider-sense". He builds wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices that shoot artificial spider-webs of his own
        design, which
        he uses both for fighting and travel, or webswing across the city. Peter Parker initially used his powers for
        his
        personal gain, but after his Uncle Ben was killed by a thief that Peter could not stop, he began to use his
        powers to
        fight crime by becoming Spider-Man.</p>
    <p>When Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in superhero comic books were usually relegated to
        the
        protagonist's sidekick role. The Spider-Man comic series broke ground by featuring Peter Parker, a high school
        student
        from the Queens borough of New York City, as Spider-Man's secret identity, whose "self-obsessions with
        rejection,
        inadequacy, and loneliness" were issues to which young readers could relate.[8] While Spider-Man was a
        quintessential
        sidekick, unlike previous teen heroes Bucky Barnes and Robin, Spider-Man had no superhero mentor like Captain
        America
        and Batman; he had learned the lesson for himself that "with great power comes great responsibility" â€”a line
        included in
        a text box in the final panel of the first Spider-Man's origin story, but later retroactively attributed to the
        late
        Uncle Ben Parker.</p>
